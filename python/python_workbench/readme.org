** Requirements
** Installation
clone git@github.com:jessenieboer/python_workbench.git, then make your own branch 
** Use
run ". gitconfig" from the project root directory
must run "direnv allow" in the project root directory (might need to make sure stuff is added to git first)

terminal commands to run to test things:

python --version - make sure it's working

which python - find interpreter location


to reload environment, nix-direnv-reload

*** troubleshooting
i had an error where the server was trying to open a folder that didn't exist anymore and running lsp-workspace-folders-remove help get rid of it. might also be useful to set the variable
(setq lsp-session-file "/path/to/your/custom/location/.lsp-session-v1")

when running pytest:
line 1: --color=yes: command not found and restarting emacs fixed it. also closing the test file i had open fixed it

had a module not found problem: not sure exactly how it got solved, maybe

originally had the directory "workbench" named "python workbench" but that made pytest unable to find stuff
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fix-the-module-not-found-error/. seems that restarting emacs helps
