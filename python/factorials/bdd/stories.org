  Feature: Check if a day is Friday
    As a developer,
    I want a function that can determine if a given day is Friday,
    so that I can confirm my BDD setup is working.

    Scenario Outline: Check if a valid day is Friday
      Given the day is "<day>"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "<result>"

      Examples:
	| day       | result |
	| Monday    | No     |
	| Tuesday   | No     |
	| Wednesday | No     |
	| Thursday  | No     |
	| Friday    | Yes    |
	| Saturday  | No     |
	| Sunday    | No     |

    Scenario: Check with lowercase Friday
      Given the day is "friday"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Yes"


    Scenario: Check with uppercase Monday
      Given the day is "MONDAY"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "No"


    Scenario: Check with Friday with leading space
      Given the day is " Friday"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Yes"


    Scenario: Check with Friday with trailing space
      Given the day is "Friday "
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Yes"


    Scenario: Check with an invalid day
      Given the day is "Funday"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Invalid day"


    Scenario: Check with an empty string
      Given the day is """"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Invalid day"


    Scenario: Check with abbreviation
      Given the day is "Fri"
      When I check if it's Friday
      Then the result should be "Invalid day"
