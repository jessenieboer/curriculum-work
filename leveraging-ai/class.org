**** Topic: Introduction to AI for Learning and Productivity
- python config in emacs was tricky. i don't know enough about python or how it works behind the scenes. plus it seems complicated in emacs, with a lot of possible configs and packages handling them. currently using PET but don't really understand it.
- ai could probably teach me the basics of getting python running, and answer specific setup questions with my config
- i asked grok some python stuff and went on a bit of a rabbit trail that helped me fix my python project template.
- grok vs python doc observations 
  - far faster to have the ai search for answers to my questions than me.
  - i can get specific information on-demand without reading a bunch of irrelevant stuff. however, reading the official docs i did run into more useful, incidental information, which might be good for general learning.
  - i can ask questions that require other sources (like asking nix-specific python questions); the ai will integrate other sources and be able to answer.
