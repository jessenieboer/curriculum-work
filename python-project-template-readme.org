clone git@github.com:jessenieboer/python-project-template.git

project structure:

<project name>
- docs
- src
  - <package name>
    - <module1 name>.py
    - <module2 name>.py
- tests
  - test_<package name>
    - test_<module1 name>.py
    - test_<module2 name>.py


run ". gitconfig" from the project root directory
must run "direnv allow" in the project root directory (might need to make sure stuff is added to git first)

terminal commands to run to test things:

python --version - make sure it's working

which python - find interpreter location


to reload environment, nix-direnv-reload

*** troubleshooting
i had an error where the server was trying to open a folder that didn't exist anymore and running lsp-workspace-folders-remove help get rid of it. might also be useful to set the variable
(setq lsp-session-file "/path/to/your/custom/location/.lsp-session-v1")

when running pytest:
line 1: --color=yes: command not found and restarting emacs fixed it. also closing the test file i had open fixed it

had a module not found problem: not sure exactly how it got solved, maybe 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fix-the-module-not-found-error/. seems that restarting emacs helps
